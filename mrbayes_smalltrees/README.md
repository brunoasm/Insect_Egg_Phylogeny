The folders with links were created to easily sort tree and parameter files.

In the case of Diptera, some chains got stuck in regions of lower posterior probability. 
I used Tracer to identify these runs and deleted their links from the appropriate folder, but original files are still stored.

Since original tree files are too large, they are omitted from the github repo and only final grafted trees are presented.
